### Embedding models 
- embedding documents
- embedding a query

These are helpful in the case of a semantic search for similarity comparison. 

The base Embedding class in LangChain consists of two methods: `embed_documents` and `embed_query` . `embed_documents` works over multiple documents, while `embed_query` works over a single document.
